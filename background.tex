\chapter{Background} \label{background}

This work describes the approach to, and algorithms for finding exact solutions to the \aspop{}. Some context for the problem, along with some details of our intended applications for it are explored in Section \ref{context} below. Section \ref{solving_ASPOP} details the starting point for the \gls{suffix filter} algorithm from the literature used in the final implementation of our solver. These \glspl{filter algorithm} are complex by nature. As such, the final algorithm is incrementally \textit{approached} by solving simpler, related problems listed in \ref{relevant}. This incremental explanation spans sections \ref{solving_P1} - \ref{P3_suff}.
